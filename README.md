## Decscription

A detailed study guide, useful while working in HTML, CCS, Git and JavaScript

This guide was developed to assist users on their journey to learning all things "code". If you are working with HTML, CCS, Git and JS this guide will help to support and lend a hand. A study guide can be a huge asset as you begin your learning and by developing this tool I was able to capture things I learned and pass them on to others.
